There is a process running in your VM called “test”.
It has an integer allocated on the heap, with its pointer on the stack. We know
the address of the pointer on the stack.
1. Get the value stored on the heap using LibVMI and print it
2. Change the value of this integer on the heap

# Execution steps

1. Compile and run test.c on Windows guest machine (windows)
2. Record the PID and stack address
3. Run monitor 
    $ sudo ./monitor windows <PID> <stack_address>
    For example
    $ sudo ./monitor  windows 3024 0x28ff0c
    Heap address 0x3b0ed0
    Test value 1
    Modify test value to 15
4. Observe on windows guest, test value is changed
